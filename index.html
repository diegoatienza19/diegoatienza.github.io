	<p> Naruto taught me many lessons in life. Naruto grew up by himself, he has no parents because his parents died when he was born. All the people in his village hated and no one acknowledge him as one of the villagers. Naruto has no friends, he always alone watching other kids playing with their friends. But after all those hatred he keep pushinh himself to find a ways to acknowledge him and after all those years alone everyone treats him like a hero. </p>
